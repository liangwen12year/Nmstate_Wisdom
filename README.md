# Translating Natural Language into Nmstate States

This repository contains a project that leverages the `transformers` library to train a
model for generating YAML states. The script is designed to tokenize a dataset, train
the model, and generate YAML states using a trained model.

## Project Structure

- `./src/`: Contains the script to train the model.

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You can then install
the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch sklearn
```
